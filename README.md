## Summary

An AI model that can predict diabetes from a person when asked a series of questions. It's been implemented so far to include a *Random Forest Classifier* and a *Deep Neural Network (Tensorflow)*. This model uses a Kaggle dataset provided
from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset. I may still try to improve this in the future.
